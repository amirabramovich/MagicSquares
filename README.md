# MagicSquares
Magic Squares are square-matrices of numbers from 1..nxn, 
where the sums of each row, column, and the two main diagonals are all the same.

to run you'll need nasm, gcc and make installed.
to run the program just type "make" and afterwards ./magic-squares X - where X is an positive odd number.
you can clean all the files by typing "make clean".
